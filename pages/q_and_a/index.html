            <h3>What time should I arrive to the ceremony?</h3>
	    <p>
            The ceremony will begin promptly at 4:00pm, so be sure to arrive early to ensure that 
            you have plenty of time to find a seat and get settled before we get started. The venue
            opens to guests thirty minutes before the ceremony starts, so there is no need to arrive
            earlier than 3:30pm.
            </p>

            <h3>When will the reception end?</h3>
	    <p>
            The reception will end around 9:30pm with a spotlit last dance down on the beach!
            </p>

            <h3>What is the dress code?</h3>
	    <p>
            Cocktail Attire!  Think cocktail dresses, jumpsuits, dark suits, 
            and ties.  If you want more info on what constitutes cocktail attire,

            <h3>What's the best way to RSVP?</h3>
	    <p>
            We haven't sent out invites yet, but for when we do...
            </p>
            <p>
            When you recieve your invitation, it will contain an RSVP card for you to fill out and 
            return to us in the provided postmarked, addressed return envelope. Please fill out and 
            send the RSVP back to us even if you cannot make it.  
            </p>
            <!--<p>
            We are so excited to check our mailbox each day to see the responses come in!
            </p>-->

            <!--<h3>When is the RSVP deadline?</h3>
            <p>
            TBD
            </p>-->

            <h3>Will the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?</h3>
	    <p>
            The ceremony will (hopefully!) take place outdoors, weather permitting.  If it rains, 
            the ceremony will be moved inside.  Rain or shine, the cocktail hour and reception 
            will be hosted indoors.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I get to the wedding venue?</h3>
            <p>
            Instructions to the venue can be found on the <a href="../accommodations/index.html">accommodations page</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Is there parking available at the wedding venue?</h3>
            <p>
            Yes! Our venue has plenty of parking.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I bring my kids?  What about a plus one?</h3>
	    <p>
            We would love to share our special day with as many people as possible, but due to venue 
            restrictions, we are unable to accommodate anyone not explicitly listed on your invitation.
            Thank you for your understanding!
            </p>

            <h3>What type of food and drink will be served during the cocktail hour and reception?</h3>
	    <p>
            After the ceremony, you will be able to enjoy drinks and hors'devours during cocktail hour,
            and will be treated thereafter to a plated dinner and dessert!  There will be vegetarian and 
            vegan options available, and we will accommodate any allergies and intolerances!
            </p>

            <h3>I have dietary restrictions/allergies. What's the best way to let you know?</h3>
	    <p>
            On the RSVP card, there is a place near the food selection to list any allergies or 
            intolerances you may have.  That is the best place to warn us of any dietary restrictions.
            </p>

            <!--<h3>Will there be an open bar?</h3>
            <p>
            TBD
            </p>-->

            <h3>Can I take pictures during the ceremony to post on social media?</h3>
	    <p>
            We invite you to be truly present with us during our nuptials with an unplugged ceremony, 
            with phones and cameras remaining out of sight until the ceremony conclusion.
            We have 2 experienced photographers capturing our day, and will happily share our professional 
            images with you after the wedding!
            </p>
